This repository contains Visual Studio projects for 3 noise reduction algorithms.  

xxxVNLMNRGL is the non local means algorithm, implmented using a compute shader.
xxxVNR2cGL is the "vanilla" non local means algorithm, implemented using a fragment shader.
xxxVNRGL is the diffusion algorithm.
xxxVTemporalNRGL is the temporal algorithm.
